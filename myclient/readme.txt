I. To run the client program, simply run client.py like any other python file. All commands are:
register: no other arguments needed
login (url): the correct url does not need to be input, just needs to have a second argument
logout: no other arguments needed
list: no other arguments needed
view: no other arguments needed
average (professor ID) (module code)
rate (professor ID) (module code) (year) (semester) (rating)

II. "sc21atw.pythonanywhere.com"

III. The password is coursework1

IV. To access the website and manually add professors and modules, use the URL 
    "sc21atw.pythonanywhere.com/admin". The root URL does not point to anywhere.
    Also apologies, I was not able to figure out how to have the Django admin pages
    default styling activate on PythonAnywhere.
